# LEAP Lab Enterprise

For companies who desire a private learning environment, we can develop a version of the course designed specifically for their needs. The course will be hosted on a secure, enterprise-grade server, and our technical partner will work with you to determine what changes and adjustments are appropriate for your needs.

We recommend an Enterprise Platform for anyone with over 50 users in a course. If you have over 500 Users we require you to have an Enterprise Platform. With an Enterprise Platform, you will also designate a Program Administrator who will receive owner access to the site, allowing them to monitor participant progress and discussions.

### Build Time
It takes four weeks from the time we receive your deposit to complete your Enterprise Platform. This is for the Enterprise Platform only and does not reflect the amount of time it takes to build a course.

### Fees
There is an Onboarding fee required for every client company in addition to the cost of course enrollment. As of January 01, 2016 this onboarding fee is $_________ per site or 10% of the course sale – whichever is greater.

### White Label
We understand the value of offering solid brand continuity when delivering any employee development program. For this reason, we offer a “white label” option for customization.

### Customization
For companies who desire a completely custom learning environment, we can design the course specifically to their companies branding.

#### Intro Video
When a participant logs into the course, they will be greeted with a brief welcome video and overview of the course content before they begin learning. If the company representative would like to film their own introduction, they can transmit the raw footage to our technical partner, and we would provide post-production editing to include audio balancing, color correction, etc. and upload it onto the course website in place of our standard video.

#### Certificate of Completion
Course participants receive a certificate of completion certifying their participation and successful completion of the program.

#### Dashboard
We have the ability to create unique user accounts for instructors and managers to quickly evaluate employee engagement within the program to see the last date each participant has logged in and how far along they are in the program.

#### Analytics
Reporting on learner retention is available to evaluate overall program success.

### Fees
Website styling, logo, and custom welcome messaging are all available for a flat rate of $15,000. This price is in addition to the Onboarding, Enrollment & Enterprise Platform pricing. This option is ONLY available for course websites set up as an Enterprise Platform.

### Licensing
Companies with an existing content management system (CMS) or learning management system (LMS) can leverage LEAP Lab content. This package would be valid for a period of time (typically one year) and includes our technical team working with their IT department to deploy our licensed course content into their system. This process includes the appropriate video, PDF, written content, testing, and certificates and is dependant on their IT and/or HR team for deployment. The first step is a planning an exploratory call between our technical team and whomever is responsible for deploying such content inside the organization.
